0. Very quick install.
----------------------

Put "plp.php" file on some directory served by a PHP enabled web server. Be sure
 to chmod a+r /var/log/mail.log first in order to allow the application to read
the mail.log file.

Remember also you need GNU/Linux wc/cut/tail commands!

1. Script options.
------------------

You can modify a few options on the script header:

$DBG = false;
$TXT_OUTPUT = false; // Set to 'true' for TXT output
$maillog = '/var/log/mail.log'; // Be sure to chmod a+r /var/log/mail.log first
$num_lines = 2000; // More than 10000 lines can take long way to complete :(

Also, you can pass a runtime parameter to change $num_lines to parse:

http://yourpage/plp.php?l=5000

This will parse 5000 main.log's lines.

Have a nice day.
